jira-2-omnifocus
================

Chrome extension for sending JIRA tickets to Omnifocus.

This extension adds a big, lovely "Send to Omnifocus" button atop the right column of the JIRA ticket page.  Click that button to quickly send a JIRA ticket into OmniFocus.  It's terribly simple, really.

Use it allocate today's work.  Use it to remember to follow up on any other ticket that may not be yours.

*NOTE*: I am not _in any way_ affiliated with Omnigroup (the folks who make OmniFocus), or with Atlassian (the folks that make JIRA).  Neither the Omnigroup nor Atlassian endorse this extension in any way, express nor implied.  They don't even know who I am.

## Known Limitations

At this time, this extension only works its magic from the ticket detail page.  That is to say that it doesn't work from any quick-edit / AJAX-overlay views of ticket information (ie, from the Kanban board, etc).
